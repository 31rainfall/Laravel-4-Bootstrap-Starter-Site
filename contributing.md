# How to Contribute

We are doing this starter site project for the community and it can only grow so much without it's support. Here are a few guidelines we would like the contributors to follow to help us keep track.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup/free) account.
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site/issues/new) for your contribution. The issue name starts with the type of pull request, either [feature] or [hotfix], followed by a short description. Then a longer description of what you plan on doing.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
